Project: nextcloud-client-sync

Author: Scott Shambarger <devel@shambarger.net>

Description:

Project creates and persistent container for the NextCloud command line
sync program.  It requires docker (or preferably podman).
It's full documentation can be found at:

  https://docs.nextcloud.com/desktop/latest/advancedusage.html#nextcloud-command-line-client

All project configuration (and defaults) are defined in:

  config.conf

Examine config.conf for all the configuration options.  To set or override
those values, create a new file:
  
  local_config.conf

Then run `create-container` to build the image, and create the container.

Usage: create-container [ debug ]
  - Creates a persistent container.  After creating it, start/stop it with:

    `docker start nextcloud-sync`
    `docker stop nextcloud-sync`

Usage: create-container run [ debug ]
  - Creates a temporary container and runs it in the foreground

"debug" in either case replaces the entrypoint with /bin/bash.

Other files:

create-image - Usage: create-image [ all ]
  - Used by create-container to build images based on alpine:latest
    that contain all the packages for nextcloudcmd.  "all" forces the
    re-creation of the nextcloud-client-base image, which includes all
    the nextcloud-client packages (large!)

Dockerfile.base - dockerfile for nextcloud-client-base

Dockerfile - based on nextcloud-client-base, adds sync entrypoint

entrypoint.sh - entrypoint script for the container
